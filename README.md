BreaKmer
========

A method to identify genomic structural variation in target regions/genes from reference-aligned high-throughput sequence data. It uses a “kmer” strategy to assemble misaligned sequence reads for predicting insertions, deletions, inversions, tandem duplications, and translocations at base-pair resolution.
